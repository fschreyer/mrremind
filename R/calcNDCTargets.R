#' Calculate NDC Emissions Targets
#'
#' @description This function calculates the emissions targets for the NDC scenarios applied in the REMIND module 45_carbonprice realization NDC.
#' It contains the following steps:
# 1. Read country-level NDC targets as absolute emissions targets in MtCO2eq/yr
# 2. Make country-specific assumptions about inclusions or adaptations of NDC targets
# 3  Extrapolate NDC targets from 2030 to 2035 for countries which do not have 2035 NDC targets (yet)
# 4. Aggregate country-level absolute emissions targets to region-level absolute emissions targets by summation ("EmiTargetAbs")
# 5. Calculate share of emissions covered under NDC target per REMIND region ("Ghgshare")
#' The parameters calculated in 3.) and 4.) are further used in the NDC realization to calculate the region-wide NDC emissions targets
#' in terms of total GHG emissions excl. bunkers and excl. LULUCF sectors.
#'
#' @param sources database source, must be 'PBL_NDC'
#' @param subtype must be one of
#' - 'EmiTargetAbs': absolute emissions targets in MtCO2eq/yr
#' - 'Ghgshare': share of emissions covered under NDC target per REMIND region

    # which should follow the Npi scenario (for countries without target).

    # 1. Target year emissions on country-level are projected by assuming the same growth rate of emissions as GDP:
    # Emi(target year) = Emi(2015) * GDP(target year) / GDP(2015).
